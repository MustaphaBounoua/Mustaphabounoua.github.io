I am a PhD candidate in the department of Data Science at Eurecom  and Ampere Software Technology. I am supervised by <a href='https://www.eurecom.fr/~michiard/'>Prof Pietro Michiardi</a> and Christophe Beaugeant. I graduated from Paris Descartes University with a Master degree in Computer science and Iâ€™m previously a graduate of a double degree in computer science at the higher school of computer science. I worked as a data
scientist at Orange and completed several internships in Machine learning at Huawei, Opta-LP and Gen-42.

Research Interests: I have broad research interests in machine learning. Specifically, my research interests lie in:

Deep generative models.
Multimodal Learning.
Representation learning.
